Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.

How to use consumers personality insights
Did you know that technologies can detect the personality of a user based on its social and web activities? If not, you may have missed one of the most important marketing innovations of recent times.

If we know more about the personality of digital users, it can be a good opportunity for marketing campaigns. Most importantly, we should be able to target our ads with laser-like efficiency, picking out individuals who will be receptive to each specific message.

Before we can discuss how to use personality insights as a marketing tool, we need to know what they are, and why they have gained recognition in recent years as an indispensable analytical technique in Digital Consumer Intelligence.

The key development has been the growth of research into ways that the language we use can be mapped into actually existing personality types. For centuries or even thousands of years, philosophers have mused about the existence of “personality types“.

This took on a classic form with the “Big Five” hypothesis. First theorized in the 19th century, this hypothesis tended to map human behavior via 5 personality factors: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (OCEAN, for short).

However, this was generally based on speculation, not hard empirical facts. The advent of Artificial Intelligence and the vast increase in computing power has provided that data, providing personality researchers with an unprecedented amount of information to test their theories.

How IBM created a powerful new tool for audience targeting

Most famously, IBM deployed its Watson AI system to look at whether textual information created by digital users could be analyzed via the OCEAN system.

Starting in 2012, Watson began to analyze words used by individuals on social media and on the web and cross-referenced them to the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count psycholinguistic dictionary (LIWC). By doing so, IBM’s technicians were able to sort users into “neurotic” or “open” – as the OCEAN system suggests.
